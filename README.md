# API-wrapper-for-Gateio
Gateio is a nice cryptocurrencies exchange that offers Spot, margin, future and contracts. The spot market can be used with the nice ccxt library.
However like many of their competitors, future contracts are not compatible with the ccxt library. 
To remedy this problem, I created a wrapper around the Gateio future API to facilitate the interaction between python and the exchange.
